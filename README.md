# Milestone-BG-Version-2


How did this project become what it is today?
    Along the way I decided to change the focus of this project. Initially the plan was to create a 2d Platformer however, I soon relieved the amount of challenges one must overcome in order to create a successfull platformer. So, I quickly decided to make the classic game everyone knows as Frogger. 

    I did not walk into this project empty handed. No, I brought all the tips and tricks I picked up while coding the platformer as well as , the knownledge I learned in class to re-create frogger as my Milestone Project #1.

How do you play?
    You start off as a inocent little frog on the bottom of the screen. Your task is simple walk across the road and make your way onto the other patch of grass. The challenge comes with trying to avoid the incoming traffic followed by landing on the logs and turtles to help you cross the river. Why can't you swim , you ask? Well, that's a topic for another project. Your goal is simple , use the arrow keys on your computer to move the frog in your desired location. GOOD LUCK! 

What happens after I make it to the finish line?
    After making it over to the other side you will respawn back to where you started. The game will add a point to your score and the game speed of all obstacles will increase slightly.
